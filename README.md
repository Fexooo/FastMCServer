# FastMCServer Experimental Branch
Just a Java Program, that creates a Minecraft Server fast and easy!

# How do I use it?
It's really easy!
Download the latest Release and start either the FastMCServer.bat or FastMCServer.sh file (depending on your Operating System), follow the on screen Instructions and answer the properties Questions.
After that everything should be setup and you're ready to start your Server.

# It doesn't work!
If something doesn't work, please follow onscreen Instructions and if nothing helps, file a Issue on this GitHub Page.

# There is something missing!
I know, that right now the Software is limited on a normal and casual Server, but I'm planning on adding new Features!
Check my to-do List and if there isn't the Feature you want open a Pull Request on GitHub.

This Program is not affiliated with Mojang or Microsoft!
